            <h3>Project 1</h3>
            <p>Design and simulate a digital stopwatch system that displays time in the following
                format HH:MM:SS the system must has a start/stop switch to allow stop watch to
                start timing and also to stop it. If the user press start it continues form the last timing
                value. The watch must also have a reset switch to reset the timing to 00:00:00. The
                system must has blinking: each second.
                Project Implementation:
                Simulate the above design using Circuit Maker 2000 or Proteus simulators.
                System Components:
                1. 6X 7490 Decade counter
                2. 6X Common Anode/Common Cathode 7-Segment Display Units
                3. 6X Common Anode/Common Cathode 7-Segment Display Decoder
                4. 2X Switches
                5. 4X LEDs
                6. 1X Clock Generator
                7. Any other basic logic gates </p>

            <h3>Project 2</h3>
            <p> Recall the Boolean expression from the Discrete mathematics course. Where
                there are certain propositional variables: p, q, r, s , t , u and if you need more
                than that you can use p1, p2, p3, ...... and there are three basic operations: + , .,
                ~ , + is for the OR operations, . Is for the AND operations and the third one is
                for the negations. And if you have certain Boolean expression you can give the
                value of that expression based on the value of the variables. For example
                p+qr and the values of p is 1 and q is 1 and r is 0 , then the value of the
                expression is 1.
                What you need to do with java programming is to build a system that consists
                of two parts:
                First Part: you have a text file that have many expression, each expression is in
                single line. You need to read each expression and system will give the value of
                each expression based on input values for each logical variable.
                
                Second part: you need to have away to read a Boolean expression and the
                system will draw the gates of the system on a panel form then based on
                variable values of input the output of the expression will show up at the end.
                You can indicated that using the color or (H/L) for each output gate.</p>
